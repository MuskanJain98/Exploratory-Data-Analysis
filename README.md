# Exploratory-Data-Analysis

Dataset is from an e-commerce website. I got the raw data and tried to clean, transform, explore the data for :
- descriptive statistics 
-relationships between variables 
-e commerce KPIs like cart aboandonment, bounce rate, inventory churn rate
-New User metrics for the website 

I have used the knowledge of:
-statistics
-visualizations in python
